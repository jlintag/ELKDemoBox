Automated ELK stack box demo deployment.
I plan to use this is as a basis for provisioning ELK related vagrant boxes (with the intent to automate using a CM tool).

Heavily follows Digital Ocean's [tutorial][1] for installing the ELK stack and has elements of [timroes/kibana4-vagrant's][2] vagrant configuration
Used [Elastic's][3] manual for everything else.
